Just for practice

Asslam-o-Alikum All!
   
   Today is my first day at Rolustec , a reputable institute.
   Today I read Trainning Mannual which is given by HR to learn out some basics of coding conventions,unit testing and maintenance.
   For maintaining my code I create GitHub account and a public repository.
   Later on my all repositories will be private.
